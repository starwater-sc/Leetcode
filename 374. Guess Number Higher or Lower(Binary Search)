1. Given function guess(mid), 0 means correct, 1 means guess(mid) is smaller than target, -1 means guess(mid) is larger than target
2. Again, set range from left to right
3. while loop, ends when right > left
4. use mid point as guess, run guess(mid) for results.

```
let guessNumber = function(n) {
    let left = 1,
        right = n

    while(left<=right){
        let mid = Math.trunc((left+right)/2);
        let res = guess(mid);
        if(res==0) return mid;
        else if(res==1) left = mid+1;
        else right = mid-1;
    }
};
```
